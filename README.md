# Digital Dice Project

Welcome to the Digital Dice guided project! If you are interested in learning a lot, please start with [Lab00](https://github.com/oconv/DigitalDiceProject/blob/main/lab00/LAB00.md). If you only want to build the Digital Dice without going through each lab, please proceed to the [kit instructions](https://github.com/oconv/DigitalDiceProject/blob/main/INSTRUCTIONS.md).

- To get your hands on a kit, please email: [Owen Convery](mailto:convery.owen@gmail.com?subject=Digital%20Dice%20Project%20Kit)
- If you would like to produce this kit for yourself, use the [production files](https://github.com/oconv/DigitalDiceProject/tree/main/prod-files)

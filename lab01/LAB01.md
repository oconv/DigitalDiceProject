# Lab01 â€“ Hardware/Software Prototyping

## Goals of this lab:

1. Familiarize ourselves with the **NUCLEO-L031K6**
2. Understand how to develope code with the **STM32CubeIDE**
3. Write a simple **BlinkTest** program for the NUCLEO
4. Write the **project code** for the STM32L031K6

### 1. NUCLEO-L031K6

STMicroelectronics produces a large catalog of high performance microcontrollers for a wide range of applications. We will be utilizing a chip from the [STML0](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32l0-series.html) line because they offer extreme power saving capabilities. This is nesecary because the dice will be battery powered and very hard to open up after assembly. Prototyping directly with an MCU can be difficult. Thankfully, ST offers the [NUCLEO-L031K6](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-l031k6.html) which utilizes the STM32L031K6 MCU. This board allows for quick and easy developement.

Here are some resources to learn more about the STM32L031K6:

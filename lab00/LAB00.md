# Lab00 - Course Overview & Setup

## You will learn how to...

Welcome to the Digital Dice guided project. The goal of this project is to teach you how to carry out a hardware/software project from start to finish! By the end of this project, you should be able to prototype your own idea, design your own circuit board, solder your own components, and write your own code!

- Prototpye with breadboards
- Design circuits & layout PCBs with Eagle
- Order custom PCBs with JLCPCB
- Soldering using THT and SMT techniques
- Write code for STM32 microcontrollers


### Lab00 – Course Overview & Setup

- Review what we will learn in this project
- Clone this github repository
- Install necessary software

### Lab01 – Hardware/Software Prototyping

- Breadboard a test a circuit
- Write/test some code

### Lab02 – Circuit Design & Board Layout

- Evaluate and choose components
- Design the circuit schematic
- Layout board with components

### Lab03 – Order PCBs & Program STM32

- Export our production files from Eagle
- Use JLCPCB to order SMD PCBs (w/ components)
- Program the microcontroller

### Lab04 – Solder & Assemble the Dice

- Solder the components to the different circuit boards
- Project evaluation and reflection

## Software Installation

For this project, we will be using a few different software tools. STM32CubeIDE is free to use, and AutoDesk offers education licenses for their whole suite of software. Follow the download links below.
